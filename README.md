# VBA-Challenge

# Description
For this challenge we had to use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. I did that in three different macros which are labeled as Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3. 

When part 1 runs, the macro will loop through all the data entries on each year sheet and it will calculate the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each ticker.

In part 2, the macro will use the min/max and match functions to return the values and tickers for the greatest % increase and greatest percent decrease values. 

For part 3, the macro will run the same functions as part 2, only, it will find and display the max of the total stock volume and the ticker that it goes with. 

# Directions
In the "VBA_Challenge_Mod_2" directory you will find 3 folders. The first folder is the "Scripts_and_Screenshots" directory, it contains two folders, both with screenshots for each year sheet and a Word doc with the full VBA Script (check notes for more info on S&S directory). The next folder is the "Solved_Workbook" directory, it contains a final draft of the workbook. In this workbook, all parts of the macro have been run so you can take a look at the final result. The last directory named "Unrun_Workbook" contains an identical workbook to the Solved Workbook, only, as its name suggests; it is unrun. In this workbook you can go to Macros, and run each part (in order) to see what it does!

# Notes
In the reference photo for the final product I didn't see the percent change column conditionally formatted, but in the rubric it stated that the column was to be conditionally formatted. So, in the "Scripts_and_Screenshots" directory, the "BothCF" folder contains the screenshots of each year sheet and script for both columns conditionally formatted. The other folder, "OneCF", contains the screenshots of each year sheet and the script for the percent change only.
